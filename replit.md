# StellForge - The GameFi + DeFi Token-Launch App

## Overview
StellForge is a Fair Token Launch Platform built on the Stellar (XLM) blockchain featuring a STAR points minting system. Users convert XLM to STAR points at a fixed rate (1 XLM = 10 STAR), and STAR holders receive 60% of the SLF token supply at Token Generation Event (TGE). The platform emphasizes minimal, professional design with wallet-gated features and a premium user experience focused on fair token distribution.

## System Architecture
StellForge is structured into several layers:
- **Smart Contract Layer**: Soroban smart contract (Launch Manager) deployed on Stellar for campaign creation, airdrop claims, and points tracking. Located in `contracts/stellforge_launch/`. Ready for deployment to testnet/mainnet.
- **Backend Layer**: A Node.js backend with planned PostgreSQL and Redis, including an indexer service for Stellar Horizon events and a REST API for campaign management and analytics. The backend also includes a comprehensive asset logo service for authentic asset images.
- **Frontend Layer**: A React 18 application built with TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS, featuring a professional, modern UI with a luxury-tech aesthetic. It includes core DeFi functionalities like swapping, liquidity management, and a token creation wizard. Integrated with Soroban contracts via `contractService.ts`.
- **Wallet Layer**: Integration with Stellar Wallet Kit for secure wallet connections supporting Freighter, xBull, and other wallets.

**Key Features & Design Choices:**
- **UI/UX**: Professional DeFi design with clean navigation, minimal color palette. Custom-designed SVG illustrations for key concepts.
- **Navigation System**: TopNav component with three main tabs (Swap, Liquidity, Projects), StellForge logo, and wallet connection.
- **Swap Interface**: Stellar DEX token swap functionality with real-time balance display, slippage tolerance, and wallet integration. Redesigned for mobile-first experience with vertical token selection and full-width buttons.
- **Liquidity Management**: View active liquidity pools, add/remove liquidity, and track user positions and statistics.
- **Token Creation Wizard**: Simplified 3-step process:
  - **Step 1 - Token Setup**: Name, symbol, supply, description, logo
  - **Step 2 - Allocation Settings**: Airdrop % (min 10%), Liquidity % (min 10%), remaining auto-calculated for creator. Minimum 10,000 XLM liquidity requirement. Optional vesting/lockup for creator allocation.
  - **Step 3 - Event & Launch**: Event duration (3-7 days), auto DEX launch when event ends, airdrop distribution based on entries and referral ranking.
- **Progress Page**: Track airdrop participation with referral links, stats, leaderboard rankings, and claimable rewards. Shows entry counts, referral counts, estimated/claimable tokens.
- **Projects Platform**: Entry-based airdrop participation with referral reward system for bringing participants.
- **Referral System**: Each participant gets unique referral link, earns bonus entries and tokens for referrals, leaderboard ranking affects final distribution.
- **Backend API**: REST endpoints for token creation with validation, airdrop join/claim, referral tracking, and progress monitoring. Full server-side validation mirrors frontend safeguards.
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js and React Three Fiber for dynamic landing page visuals.
- **State Management**: Zustand for efficient application state.
- **Wallet Integration**: Stellar Wallet Kit supporting Freighter, xBull, and other Stellar wallets.
- **Accessibility**: Reduced-motion support and responsive design for all devices.
- **Deployment**: Express backend serves both API and built frontend in production; Vite proxy for development.
